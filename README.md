   ```
2. **Move the folder to the WordPress plugins directory:**

## 🚀 API Usage
### 📥 Retrieve Product List
```sh
curl -X GET "http://your-site.com/wp-json/custom-woo/v1/products" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### ➕ Create a New Product
```sh
curl -X POST "http://your-site.com/wp-json/custom-woo/v1/products" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS" \
     -d '{ "name": "New Product", "price": 99.99, "stock": 10 }'
```

## 🔐 Authentication
To perform `POST` and `DELETE` requests, **Basic Auth** is required. You can obtain a Base64 token using PowerShell:
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("your_username:your_password"))
```
